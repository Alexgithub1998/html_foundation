        <h2>Understanding JavaScript</h2>

      <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core
        technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites
        use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often
        incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a
        dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
        conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing,
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
        multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
        programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
        working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).
      </p>
      <p>
        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as
        networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser
        or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers but are now
        core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most
        popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js. Although Java and
        JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries,
        the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
      </p>

      <h3>Website Client-side Usage</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with
        99% of all websites using it for this purpose. Scripts are embedded in or
        included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. All major web
        browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the
        user's device.
      </p>

      <h3>Examples of Scripted Behavior</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a
          WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive
          messages without leaving the current page.
        </li>
        <li>Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out.</li>
        <li>Playing browser games.</li>
        <li>Controlling the playback of streaming media.</li>
        <li>Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.</li>
        <li>
          Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web
          server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server.
        </li>
        <li>Redirecting a user to another page.</li>
        <li>
          Storing and retrieving data on the user's device, via the storage or
          IndexedDB standards.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Web Libraries and Frameworks</h3>

      <h4>React</h4>
      <p>
        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source
        front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on
        components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community
        of individual developers and companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered
        applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned
        with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React
        applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side
        functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those
        parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of
        unchanged DOM elements.
      </p>

      <h4>Angular</h4>
      <p>
        Angular is a TypeScript-based, free, and open-source single-page web
        application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and a community of
        developers and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same
        team that built AngularJS.
      </p>

      <h4>jQuery</h4>
      <p>
        In 2012, jQuery was the most popular client-side library, used by over 75%
        of websites. While still in widespread use, its popularity has been
        surpassed by newer libraries and frameworks.
      </p>

      <h4>Vanilla JS</h4>
      <p>
        The framework-like moniker "Vanilla JS" is a term coined for websites that
        don't use any libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on
        standard JavaScript functionality.
